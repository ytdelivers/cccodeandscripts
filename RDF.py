BACKGROUND:
This script will calculate the 3D radial distribution function from a specified trajectory PDB file.
Trajectory PDB files are individual PDB files strung together, separated by the keyword "ENDMDL".
It is important for viewers, such as VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), to ensure that 
each of the configurations (idividual frames) has the same number of atoms. This can be problematic 
for viewing trajectories of Monte Carlo simulations. There are, however, ways of tricking the viewers 
to play the files. A perl script which does this can be downloaded from the MPMC/tools/ directory 
(called vmdfixn.pl) at http://code.google.com/p/mpmc/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Ftools.

WHAT YOU NEED TO MODIFY IN THIS SCRIPT:
This script assumes that there are center of mass sites for every molecule in the trajectory PDB file.
For example, if N2 is the species under consideration, there assumes that halfway between the nitrogens
resides a site with definitive coordinates, let's call it "N2G". For molecules such as CO2 and CH4,
this is not an issue, as the carbon atoms are the center of masses of the molecules. If you do not 
have these center of mass sites for your molecule(s) of interest, consider downloading the original 
python script (http://www.sicmm.org/~stas/rdf-script/) from which mine is a modified version of.
This original script has a flag (cm=True) which will auto-magically compute the COM sites for your
molecules.

This only one line which needs to be changed for you to successfully run this script, is the line

if line[12:15] != "N2G":                   # XXX Identifying label for center of gravity (COM) site

This line (line 67) is clearly marked with XXX, which highlights in editors such as vim.
